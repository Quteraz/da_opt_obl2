Implement  a genetic algorithm for the graph coloring problem ( each node can have three colours : 
Black, White, Red ).  The graph coloring problem consists of assigning  colors to different  nodes of the 
graph such that two nodes having an edge between them ( two nodes that are neighbors ) should not 
have the same color.  The fitness is the number of edges that are not satisfied. 

-   The size of the initial population should be at least 2 individuals . Use a random algorithm to 
initialize the initial population.

-   Use  the 2-points crossover  followed by mutation ( probability = 0.1) and one point crossover with 
mutation ( probability = 0.1)

-   What individuals should go to the next generation:; your own choice. 
    Stopping criteria :  your  own choice.
    
  Test your genetic algorithm on some  random graphs.  The number of neighbors each node may have 
is your own choice. What is your conclusion when you compare 2 point cross over an done point 
crossover
